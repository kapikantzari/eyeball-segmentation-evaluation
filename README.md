# eyeball-segmentation-evaluation
Compute the performance metrics (dice coefficient, intersection over union, Matthew's correlation coefficient, accuracy, and Hausdorff distance) between the computer segmentation results and radiologist segmentation results. Visualize the results on the original CT scan and export both numerical results and overlaid image files to a customized location.
