# segmentation-evaluation
Compute the performance metrics (dice coefficient, intersection over union, Matthew's correlation coefficient, accuracy, Hausdorff distance, sensitivity, precision, and F measure) between the computer segmentation results and radiologist segmentation results. Visualize the results on the original CT scan and export both numerical results and overlaid image files to a customized location.
